## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I serve as a Board member for Plowsharing Crafts, a not-for-profit, fair trade store with two brick and mortar locations. Currently, 35-40% of the company's sales take place at offsite locations such as festivals, church bazaars and conferences. But, there is no system by which to track which sales are the most profitable year-over-year, which sales have the highest return on investment or even which sales we consistently attend.  The soon-to-retire Executive Director has this data in his head and on paper scattered throughout files.  
+An application that would store detailed information related to each offsite sale, calculate the ROI for the sale and help to determine profitability for each sale location would allow the new Executive Director to make analytical decisions about which sales are profitable enough to attend and where to allocate our resources (volunteer hours and inventory). 

### Features
+Log In - the Exectutive Director will be able to log in to access tasks they have authority over (create, edit, search and sort).
+Log In - the two Store Managers will be able to log in to access tasks they have authority over (edit, search and sort.  They will not be able to create sales.).
Create - the Executive Director will be able to create offsite sale objects that include all neccessary data for analytic decision making.
+Edit - the Executive Director and the Store Managers will be able to edit offsite sales to assign volunteers and record expenses and sales.
+Search - the Executive Director and the Store Managers will be able to search completed offsite sales
+Sort - the Executive Director and the Store Managers will be able to sort completed offsite sales by year, location, name, ROI
### Technologies

how to calculate ROI within Thymeleaf (pulling data from objects and then making calculations with it and sending it back to view)
+how to sort database and display entries by various criteria
+pulling and using Google maps data to determine location of sales which determines mileage expense.
+everything CSS/Bootstrap - this is where my experience is the weakest
